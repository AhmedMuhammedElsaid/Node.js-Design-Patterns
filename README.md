# 🎯 Design Patterns in Software Engineering.

Welcome to the **Design Patterns** repository! This project contains categorized implementations of the most commonly used **object-oriented design patterns**, each explained with examples and clean code.

> 🧠 **Design patterns** are tried-and-true solutions to common problems in software design. They promote code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.

----------------------

## 🧱 Categories Covered.

### 🔨 1. [Creational Patterns](./creational-patterns/)
> Focus on the **creation of objects**, abstracting the instantiation process.

| Pattern            | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Singleton**       | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access. |
| **Factory Method**  | Delegates the instantiation to subclasses. |
| **Abstract Factory**| Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. |
| **Builder**         | Constructs complex objects step by step. |
| **Prototype**       | Clones existing objects instead of creating new ones. |

------------------------

### 🧱 2. [Structural Patterns](./structural-patterns/)
> Concerned with the **structure** of classes and objects—how they are composed to form larger systems.

| Pattern         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Adapter**      | Converts one interface into another to match client expectations. |
| **Bridge**       | Separates abstraction from its implementation. |
| **Composite**    | Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly. |
| **Decorator**    | Adds behavior to objects dynamically. |
| **Facade**       | Provides a simplified interface to a complex system. |
| **Flyweight**    | Shares common data to reduce memory usage. |
| **Proxy**        | Controls access to another object. |

## ✅ Project Goals

- 📚 **Educational**: Help developers understand key OOP design patterns.
- ⚙️ **Practical**: Provide real-world-style code examples in an easy-to-digest format.
- 🌐 **Extensible**: Support multiple programming languages (starting with JavaScript).
