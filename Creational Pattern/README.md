# 🎨 Design Patterns - Creational Patterns

Welcome to the **Creational Patterns** section of the **Design Patterns** series. This repository demonstrates the implementation and use of creational design patterns in software engineering.

> 💡 Creational patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. They help make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

---

## 📁 Patterns Included

| Pattern Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Singleton** | Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. |
| **Factory Method** | Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created. |
| **Builder** | Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. |
| **Prototype** | Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance and creates new objects by copying this prototype. |

---

## 🧰 Usage

Each pattern is implemented in its own folder. Code examples are language-agnostic by concept but can be implemented in any language (e.g., Python, Java, C#, etc.).

```bash
cd Singleton
# run or test the example in your language of choice

✅ Goals
Provide real-world analogies and simple code examples.

Help developers understand when and how to apply each creational pattern.

Promote clean code practices using design patterns.

Would you like this tailored for a specific programming language (e.g., Python, Java)? I can generate code stubs for each pattern too.
